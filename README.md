# ShortcutRepo

**WARNING:** I'm not responsible for anything caused by any Shortcuts in this repository. Anyways, This stuff is all homemade on my iPad, and as you can probably guess, these are ONLY Shortcuts. Here's how to install any Shortcuts listed.

1. Download Shortcut from Safari on an iPad, iPhone, or iPod touch
2. Make sure that Untrusted Shortcuts are enabled in Settings > Shortcuts > Allow Untrusted Shortcuts
3. Make sure Shortcuts is installed
4. Tap Shortcut and let everything run

I made this GitHub repository just because I wanted to share my Shortcuts that I make and it is better than sharing everything individually on Reddit where no one will see it.
